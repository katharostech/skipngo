> ⚠️ **Warning:** Skip'n Go is very work-in-progress and is not usable yet.

Skip'n Go is a game engine designed to let you make 2D games as easily as possible. Initially the engine will be very specific to supporting a gameplay style similar to Legend of Zelda© Link to the Past©. As time goes on the engine may develop to support more game styles.

The game engine is powered by the Rust programming language and the [Bevy] game engine, but Rust will not be required to write Skip'n Go games. Games will be written by simply editing YAML files, [LDtk] map files, sprite images and tilesets, and, in the future, probably, Python scripts.
