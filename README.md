> ⚠️ **Warning:** Skip'n Go is very work-in-progress and is not usable yet.

Skip'n Go is a game engine designed to let you make 2D games as easily as possible. Initially the engine will be very specific to supporting a gameplay style similar to Legend of Zelda© Link to the Past©, which makes it more of a game building "kit" than an engine. As time goes on Skip'n Go may develop to support more game styles and become more of a general purpose 2D game engine, but it will be, for now, mostly driven by the needs of our own commercial game project.

The game engine is powered by the Rust programming language and the [Bevy] game engine, but Rust will not be required to write Skip'n Go games. Games will be written by simply editing YAML files, [LDtk] map files, sprite images and tilesets, and, in the future, probably, Python scripts.
